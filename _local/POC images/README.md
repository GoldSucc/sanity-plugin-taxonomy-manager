## Config File

`config.dist.json` is where the plugin config object lives. 
- It is installed in the Sanity /config folder when the plugin is installed. 
- This is where use accessible plugin config options should go. 
- If/when I want to use this, move it back into the plugin root directory. 
- Be sure to add config instructions to the README file.
